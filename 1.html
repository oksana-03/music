    <h1>Imagine Dragons "Demons"</h1>
    <i><p>When the days are cold<br>
        And the cards all fold<br>
        And the saints we see are all made of gold<br>
        When your dreams all fail<br>
        And the ones we hail<br>
        Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale<br>
        I wanna hide the truth<br>
        I wanna shelter you<br>
        But with the beast inside<br>
        There's nowhere we can hide<br>
        No matter what we breed<br>
        We still are made of greed<br>
        This is my kingdom come<br>
        This is my kingdom come<br>
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        At the curtain's call<br>
        It's the last of all<br>
        When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl<br>
        So they dug your grave<br>
        And the masquerade<br>
        Will come calling out at the mess you've made<br>
        Don't wanna let you down<br>
        But I am hell-bound<br>
        Though this is all for you<br>
        Don't wanna hide the truth<br>
        No matter what we breed<br>
        We still are made of greed<br>
        This is my kingdom come<br>
        This is my kingdom come<br>
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        They say it's what you make<br>
        I say it's up to fate<br>
        It's woven in my soul<br>
        I need to let you go<br>
        Your eyes, they shine so bright<br>
        I wanna save that light<br>
        I can't escape this now<br>
        Unless you show me how<br>
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br>
        It's where my demons hide<br> </p></i>
